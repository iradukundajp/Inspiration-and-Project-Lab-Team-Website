                    The Neighbourhood Resource Sharing App is designed to help local communities share resources efficiently. The platform allows users to lend, borrow, and request items such as tools, books, appliances, and other essentials.
                <p>
                    For example, instead of buying a power drill you'll only use once, you can borrow one from a neighbor. Hosting visitors but donâ€™t have an extra mattress? Just get one through the app. Need a glass cutter or gardening tools to clean your yard? A neighbor might already have exactly what you need. The app helps you save money, reduce waste, and build stronger, more helpful communities.
